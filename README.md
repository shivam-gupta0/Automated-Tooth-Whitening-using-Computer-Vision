**Project Overview<br>**
The goal of this project is to automate the tooth whitening process using computer vision techniques. The algorithm takes an input image of a person's smile and enhances the appearance of the teeth by applying a whitening effect. The project consists of the following key steps:<br>

Detection and segmentation of the mouth region using Haar cascades.<br>
First-layer segmentation to isolate the lips for further processing.<br>
Second-layer segmentation to extract the teeth region.<br>
Applying a tooth whitening algorithm using color transformation and bilateral filtering.<br>

**Key Skills Demonstrated**<br>
Image processing and computer vision techniques<br>
Object detection and segmentation using Haar cascades<br>
Feature extraction and region growing algorithms<br>
Color space manipulation and transformation<br>
Filtering techniques for enhancing image quality<br>
Integration of various image processing steps into a cohesive pipeline<br>
